# An Instrumental Variables Framework to Unite Spatial Confounding Methods

This repository contains the code for the simulation and data application sections of the paper. The workflow is:
- 'funcs.R' contains all utility functions for the simulation and data applicaton. The main function is 'ctseff' adapted from the [npcausal](https://github.com/ehkennedy/npcausal/tree/master) package with minor modifications.
- 'simulation' contains the code for the simulation section of the paper.
- 'data_application' contains the code for the data application section of the paper.

The computations in this paper were run on the FASRC cluster supported by the FAS Division of Science Research Computing Group at Harvard University.
