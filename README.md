# Scale of Spatial Confounding

Sophie Woodward, Mauricio Tec, Francesca Dominici

One of the challenges facing spatial causal inference  is spatial confounding, which arises due to the presence of an unmeasured, spatially-varying variable that influences both exposure and outcome. Recent methods to address spatial confounding include 1) distance-adjusted propensity score methods (Papadogeorgou et al. 2019) 2) doubly robust machine learning methods that control for space, summarized in (Ogburn et al. 2022), 3) semi-parametric spline-based methods relying on linear mixed models (Thaden & Kneib 2018, Osama et al. 2019, Dupont et al. 2022). A limitation of many of these methods, as pointed out by Khan & Berret (2023), is that researchers assume the observed data do not give insight into whether spatial confounding is present or in what ways it should be accounted for.

This project will expand on existing methods by addressing the latter point. The data we have access to provides us an advantage: we can learn the association of air pollution exposure and confounders within finer areal units, such as zip codes and census tracts, allowing us to make assumptions about the scale of spatial confounding. We will then leverage this information to make inference robust to spatial confounding.
